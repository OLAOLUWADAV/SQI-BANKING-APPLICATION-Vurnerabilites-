# SQI-BANKING-APPLICATION-Vurnerabilites-

Banking App Red Team Vulnerability Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive, feature-by-feature vulnerability assessment of a banking application from a red team perspective. It is designed to serve as both a security reference for developers and a playbook for pentesters.

üöÄ Project Overview

Modern banking platforms face a wide range of sophisticated threats. This analysis evaluates the security posture across all critical features and edge cases, offering detailed attack vectors and corresponding defenses.

Key Objectives

Identify potential weaknesses in each functional area

Describe realistic attack vectors, including edge cases

Propose actionable mitigations and security best practices

Serve as a living document for continuous security improvement

üîç Features & Vulnerability Matrix

Each major feature of the banking app is broken down into user stories, common and edge-case vulnerabilities, attack scenarios, and recommended defenses.

Login & Authentication

User stories: Phone/email + password login, optional MFA (OTP/SMS, app-based).

Includes credential stuffing, OTP replay, session fixation, SIM-swap mitigation, biometric spoofing, and password reset abuses.

Account Dashboard

User stories: View balances, transaction history, limits.

Covers IDOR risks, race conditions, DOM‚Äëbased XSS, data overexposure.

Fund Transfer

User stories: Transfer to beneficiaries with OTP/biometric confirmation.

Addresses parameter tampering, logic abuse (split transfers), OTP brute‚Äëforce, replay attacks.

Bill Payments & Recharge

User stories: Utilities payments, mobile/internet recharge.

Includes fake confirmations, callback spoofing, double spending, phantom recharges.

Notifications & Alerts

User stories: SMS/email/app alerts for transactions and logins.

Examines email spoofing, SMS injection, log forging, malicious deep links.

Account Settings & Profile

User stories: Update personal info, passwords, notification preferences.

Discusses insecure password changes, cross‚Äëdevice sync silencing, token hijack, enumeration.

Document Upload (KYC)

User stories: Upload identity documents.

Reviews malicious file uploads, zip bomb attacks, broken access control, watermark tampering.

Admin Panel / Backoffice

User stories: Staff operations (fraud resolution, account freezes).

Focuses on privilege escalation, insecure auditing, lack of MFA, stored XSS.

Transaction History & Export

User stories: View/export PDF/CSV statements.

Covers CSV injection, excessive export abuse, template injection.

API Gateway / Public Endpoints

User stories: All frontend/mobile calls via gateway.

Examines rate limiting, header manipulation, token logging, insecure CORS.

üõ°Ô∏è Using This Analysis

For Developers

Incorporate the defense recommendations into your CI/CD pipeline.

Harden each endpoint using the suggested checks and libraries.

Regularly review and update threat models as features evolve.

For Security Teams

Use the attack vectors as test cases in pentest engagements.

Automate detection of edge-case exploits via custom scripts.

Validate that logs, alerts, and telemetry capture malicious behaviors.
